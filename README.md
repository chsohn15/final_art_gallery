# K & C Art Gallery

The K & C Art Gallery is a virtual art gallery meant to recreate the experience of being in an art museum. Users can browse through curated exhibits and examine individuals paintings through a magnified view. They can also take virtual and audio tours of selected paintings.These tours contain a special scroll-responsive zoom feature for users to carefully peruse different parts of the painting as they read or hear about it. Users can also try the interactive art exhibit, add paintings to their own collection, and write their own notes for each saved painting. 

To run this project, open the folder 'backend', run bundle install and 'rails s.' In the 'frontend' folder, run 'open index.html' in the terminal.
